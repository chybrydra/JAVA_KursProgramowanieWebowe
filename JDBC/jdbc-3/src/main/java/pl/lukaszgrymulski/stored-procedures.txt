I added some stored procedures to MySQL using this:
stored procedure is a ready SQL statement, it's body is inside MySQL so I need to call it

The codes below are supposed to add stored procedures to MySQL DB:

===== STORED PROCEDURE 1 =====
	DELIMITER //
	CREATE PROCEDURE increase_salaries_for_department(IN the_department VARCHAR(64), IN increase_amount DECIMAL(10,2))
	BEGIN
	 UPDATE employees2
	 SET salary= salary + increase_amount
	 WHERE department=the_department;
	END //
	DELIMITER ;

===== STORED PROCEDURE 2 =====
    DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE greet_the_department(INOUT department VARCHAR(64))
BEGIN
	SET department = concat('Hello to the awesome ', department, ' team!');
END//
DELIMITER ;


===== STORED PROCEDURE 3 =====
    DELIMITER //
    CREATE PROCEDURE get_employees_for_department(IN the_department VARCHAR(64))
    BEGIN
    	SELECT * from employees2 where department=the_department;
    END //
    DELIMITER ;

===== STORED PROCEDURE 4 =====
    DELIMITER //
    CREATE PROCEDURE get_count_for_department(IN the_department VARCHAR(64), OUT the_count INT)
    BEGIN
    	SELECT COUNT(*) INTO the_count FROM employees2 where department=the_department;
    END //
    DELIMITER ;
